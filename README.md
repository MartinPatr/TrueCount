# TrueCount ‚Äì Transparent, Tamper-Proof Voting

**TrueCount** is a decentralized **commit‚Äìreveal voting system** built for communities that need fairness, transparency, and verifiable results. No moderators. No tampering. Every vote is private until revealed, and then it is permanently auditable on-chain.

## üéØ Inspiration

One of our teammates experienced a moment in student body government where a candidate's votes were reduced by half because a moderator believed she violated a subjective rule. The issue wasn't just the penalty ‚Äî it was how easily one person's judgment could undermine trust in the entire process.

**TrueCount was born to fix this.** By moving voting on-chain, we eliminate human bias and create a system where **trust is placed in code, not moderators**.

## üõ† Tech Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|-------------|
| **Smart Contracts** | Solidity, Hardhat, Ignition |
| **Frontend** | React, TypeScript, wagmi, RainbowKit, viem |
| **UI/UX** | TailwindCSS, react-hot-toast, react-countdown |
| **Development** | Hardhat node for local blockchain simulation |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask or compatible wallet

### Installation


1. **Backend Setup (Blockchain)**
   ```bash
   cd ../truecount-backend
   npm install
   npm run compile
   npm run node  # Start local blockchain
   ```
   > Keep this terminal running - it will be your local blockchain!

2. **Deploy Smart Contracts**
   
   In a new terminal:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy  # Deploy smart contracts
   ```
   
   üìã **Important**: Copy the deployed contract address from the output and add to NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS in env

3. **Launch Frontend**
   
   In another terminal:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   üåê Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and connect your wallet *We recommend using Metamask
   (Both web application and blockchain are locally hosted)
   
## üó≥ Voting Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Create Poll
```solidity
createPoll(numOptions, commitSecs, revealSecs)
```

### Phase 2: Commit Vote
- üé≤ Generate random 32-byte salt client-side
- üîí Compute `commitment = keccak256(encodePacked(option, salt, voter, pollId))`
- üì§ Call `commit(pollId, commitment)`

### Phase 3: Reveal Vote
- üì± Retrieve `{option, salt}` from localStorage
- üîì Call `reveal(pollId, option, salt)`
- ‚úÖ Smart contract verifies commitment matches

### Phase 4: Finalize Results
- üîê Call `finalize(pollId)` to lock results permanently
- üìä Results become immutable and publicly auditable

## üèõÔ∏è Smart Contract

### SealedVote.sol
The core smart contract implementing the commit-reveal voting scheme:

```solidity
contract SealedVote {
    struct Poll {
        uint64 commitEnd;           // Commit phase end timestamp
        uint8 numOptions;           // Number of voting options
        address creator;            // Poll creator
        string title;               // Poll title
        string description;         // Poll description
        string[] options;           // Voting options
        mapping(address => bytes32) commitment;  // Voter commitments
        mapping(address => bool) revealed;       // Reveal status
        uint32[] tally;             // Vote counts per option
    }
}
```

### Key Functions
- `createPoll()` - Create a new voting poll
- `commit()` - Submit vote commitment
- `reveal()` - Reveal committed vote
- `getTally()` - Get current vote counts
- `getCommitEnd()` - Get commit phase end time

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Vote Privacy
- Votes are encrypted using commitment schemes
- No vote information is visible during commit phase
- Salt values prevent vote enumeration

### Vote Integrity
- Cryptographic verification of vote commitments
- Immutable vote storage on blockchain
- Public verification of vote authenticity

### Access Control
- Only poll creators can create polls
- One vote per address per poll
- Time-based phase enforcement

## üîß Backend Scripts

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Deploy contracts
npm run deploy

# Advance blockchain time (for testing)
npm run advance-time

# Check poll status
npm run check-poll <pollId>

# Create demo poll
npm run create-demo

# Start local blockchain
npm run node
```

### Utility Scripts
- `deploy.js` - Deploy smart contracts
- `advance-time.js` - Advance blockchain time for testing
- `check-poll.js` - Check poll status and details
- `create-demo-poll.js` - Create a demo student government poll

## üß™ Testing

### Demo Poll Creation
```bash
cd truecount-backend
npm run create-demo
```

This creates a student government election poll with:
- 4 candidates
- 1-hour commit phase
- 1 committed vote for demonstration

### Time Advancement
```bash
cd truecount-backend
npm run advance-time
```

Advances blockchain time to test phase transitions.
