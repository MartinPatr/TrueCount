# TrueCount Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a complete voting system with RainbowKit/wagmi integration, phase logic, and vote workflow as requested.

## Features Implemented

### 1. RainbowKit/Wagmi Integration
- ✅ Wallet connection using RainbowKit
- ✅ Support for multiple wallets (MetaMask, Coinbase, etc.)
- ✅ Connected wallet state management
- ✅ Transaction state handling

### 2. Contract Integration
- ✅ Custom hooks for all contract functions:
  - `pollCount()` - Get total number of polls
  - `getPollTimes(pollId)` - Get commit and reveal end times
  - `getNumOptions(pollId)` - Get number of options for a poll
  - `getTally(pollId)` - Get current vote tally and finalization status
  - `hasCommitted(pollId, voter)` - Check if voter has committed
  - `hasRevealed(pollId, voter)` - Check if voter has revealed
- ✅ State-changing functions:
  - `createPoll(numOptions, commitSeconds, revealSeconds)`
  - `commit(pollId, commitment)`
  - `reveal(pollId, option, salt)`
  - `finalize(pollId)`

### 3. Phase Logic
- ✅ Automatic phase detection:
  - `now < commitEnd` → COMMIT phase
  - `commitEnd <= now < revealEnd` → REVEAL phase
  - `now >= revealEnd` → FINALIZE phase
- ✅ Real-time countdown timers
- ✅ Button state management based on phase
- ✅ Visual phase progress indicators

### 4. Vote Workflow
- ✅ Salt generation: 32-byte random hex
- ✅ Vote data storage: `{pollId,address}->{option,salt}` in localStorage
- ✅ Commitment computation: `keccak256(encodePacked(option, salt, voter, pollId))`
- ✅ Complete commit → reveal → finalize workflow
- ✅ Vote data cleanup after reveal

### 5. UI Components
- ✅ **Find Poll Page**: Shows all polls with real contract data
- ✅ **Create Poll Page**: Creates polls on blockchain with duration settings
- ✅ **Poll Detail Page**: Complete voting interface with phase management
- ✅ **Navigation**: Wallet connection integration
- ✅ **Toast Notifications**: Transaction state feedback

### 6. UX Features
- ✅ Countdown timers for each phase
- ✅ Disabled/enabled buttons based on phase and user state
- ✅ Toast notifications for:
  - Transaction pending
  - Transaction confirmed
  - Transaction errors
  - User feedback messages
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error handling

## Technical Implementation

### Contract ABI
The contract ABI is defined in `/src/lib/contract.ts` with all required functions.

### Custom Hooks
All contract interactions are abstracted into custom hooks in `/src/hooks/usePollData.ts`:
- `usePollCount()` - Get total poll count
- `usePollData(pollId)` - Get complete poll data with phase logic
- `useCreatePoll()` - Create new polls
- `useCommitVote()` - Commit votes
- `useRevealVote()` - Reveal votes
- `useFinalizePoll()` - Finalize polls

### Vote Utilities
Vote-related utilities in `/src/lib/voteUtils.ts`:
- Salt generation
- Commitment computation
- Local storage management
- Time formatting

### Phase Management
The phase logic automatically updates every second and:
1. Calculates current phase based on timestamps
2. Updates countdown timers
3. Enables/disables appropriate buttons
4. Shows phase-specific UI elements

## Usage

1. **Connect Wallet**: Use the Connect button in the navigation
2. **Create Poll**: Go to Create Poll page, fill details, set duration, submit
3. **Find Polls**: Browse available polls on Find Poll page
4. **Vote**: Click on a poll to access the voting interface:
   - **Commit Phase**: Select option and commit vote
   - **Reveal Phase**: Reveal your committed vote
   - **Finalize Phase**: Finalize poll to see results

## Contract Address
Update the `SEALED_VOTE_ADDRESS` in `/src/lib/contract.ts` with your deployed contract address.

## Dependencies
- `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit` - Wallet connection
- `wagmi` - Ethereum interaction
- `viem` - Low-level Ethereum utilities
- `@tanstack/react-query` - Data fetching and caching
